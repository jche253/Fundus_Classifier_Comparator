To use addImagesToDb.sh:
    At the couchdb with url
    http://127.0.0.1:54956/
    create an empty database called ret_images
    Then run the script e.g.
    find ../images -name *.jpg | xargs addImagesToDb.sh

New method addImagesToDb_jkc
    install couchrest gem (sudo gem install couchrest)
    edit script: change baseDir location on line 6
    edit script: change dbname

not longer (Create a database called image_compare_results )

create a image compare list

create a task for each user



Configurator files are (unfinished!) web based tool to add images and other functionality

basic_views.json is the code for the views of the couchdb - handy for when recreating a db.

genComparisonOrder.rb
    This is a script that takes a number (which represents the number of docs) then generates a shuffled order of that many numbers.
    Maybe it can also put this document into the db. If so, it should take a name.
